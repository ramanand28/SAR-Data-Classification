# SAR-Data-Classification
Synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) is an active microwave sensor, whose resolution—both in range and azimuth—can be improved via the pulse compression technique and synthetic aperture principle, to obtain high resolution remote sensing images. Moreover, another advantage of SAR imaging is its ability to operate on an all-weather/all-day-and-night basis . Its application has been of interest in a variety of fields , e.g., SAR-based ocean remote sensing is widely used for environmental monitoring, search and rescue, target recognition, etc. Spaceborne SAR can also be operated over long periods in wide-area and real-time observations. In this context, it became a fundamental system for ship target recognition . 

In the recent times, deep convolutional networks have outperformed the state of art in visual recognition tasks.while the traditional use of convolutional networks is classification tasks, where the output to input image is a single label class . In many visual recognition tasks main in the multi label earth surface classification must include localization i,e class label is assigned to each pixel . we trained network by creating a patch around that pixel and sliding through whole image and the network should predict the class label .
	In this method we selected a moderate sliding window size because if window size is more than larger the patch size is, larger patches require more pooling layers to reduce the localisation accuracy, while small patches allow the network to see little context.Small patches with lot of  overlapping is both computationally intensive and results in redundant . A good trade off between the context information and localisation is vital.
	Main aim of the strategy is to classify multi labels in SAR data image using Deep neural networks, to be specific we want to classify the classes in the SAR data like coconut trees , lakes, land .
